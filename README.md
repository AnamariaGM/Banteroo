# Real-Time Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built using React Native, Expo, Django, and Django Channels. Users can create accounts, send friend requests, accept them, and message their friends in real-time using websockets.

## Features

* Account creation and authentication
* Friend requests and acceptance
* Real-time messaging with friends
* User-friendly interface
* Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android)

## Prerequisites

Before running this application locally or deploying it to a server, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* Node.js and npm
* Python and pip
* Redis server


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

### Backend (Django)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnamariaGM/Banteroo
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd https://github.com/AnamariaGM/Banteroo/api
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Configure Environment Variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
    - Add necessary environment variables. Here's an example:

      ```plaintext
      # Django settings
      SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
      DEBUG=False
      ALLOWED_HOSTS=your_domain_or_IP_here

      # Redis configuration
      REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
      REDIS_PORT=6379

      # Database configuration (if using SQLite)
      DB_NAME=db.sqlite3
      DB_USER=
      DB_PASSWORD=
      DB_HOST=
      DB_PORT=

      # Other settings...
      ```

6. Run Migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### Frontend (React Native)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd https://github.com/AnamariaGM/Banteroo/app
    ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Expo development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to view the app.
